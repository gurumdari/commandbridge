CommandBridge
======
CommandBridge is a software architecture that enables communication between heterogeneous language applications in a local environment through a command-line interface to be universal and stable without an additional extension module.

Because all programming languages have advantages and disadvantages, it is sometimes inefficient to develop them in one language only. This is why it works with another languages that are specific to a particular feature or that can be implemented well. However, there are a lot of inconveniences when it is actually linked. You need to install an extension module for interworking. somtimes, these extensions may require a specific version of the programming language. They are also necessary to learn how to use it because usage is also different for each extension module, for each language. However, since CommandBridge use a command-line interface without an additional extension module, there is no coupling between the caller language and the callee language, and the interoperation method provides a universal common method.
